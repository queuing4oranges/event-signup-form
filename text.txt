-action="book.php" - distinguishes which file is responsible to handle the data after the submit button is hit
-isset - checks if a certain value has been set; here if data has been sent to us via the GET method
-data that is sent, is stored in the $_GET variable (or others) - so email, name, date is stored in that array
-check with isset if $_GET and submit - means if data is sent to the server by the submit btn

how to prevent user from inserting malicious code:
-we use specialchars! they convert characters, so they cannot execute

form validation:
(server-side validation, using php)
1. check if the fields are not empty! - one for each for with if
2. we check that e.g. sth is actual an email (for example with filter, but php only has filters for certain things; so need to validate ourselves -> regex)
- instead of echoing after else, we store the value in a variable now - like this: $email = $_POST['email'];
-after that, we can check with an if statement (here in !negation, bc. otherwise the if would be empty)
-preg_match - how we are matching something to a regular expression, first argument is the filter, second is the argument that's been checked

showing errors:
-we dont want to echo out errors, but show them in the form itself
-therefore we need to store the error message in a variable
- we do that by creating an associative array ($errors) and store the message with their keys ['name'=>'', 'email'=>'', 'event'=>'']
- values are empty, cause there is no error in the beginning
